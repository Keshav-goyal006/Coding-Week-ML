This repository contains Task 1 and some of Task 2 solved for the Coding Week Machine Learning.
For the Task1 we obtained an accuracy less than the Dumb model predicting No 
The following models of libraries were used:<br>
pandas 2.2.3<br>
numpy 2.2.6<br>
matplotlib 3.10.3<br>
seaborn 0.13.2<br>
plotly 6.1.1<br>
sklearn 1.6.1<br>
The flow of Task 1 file goes like:<br>
guessing the feature names to EDA to prediction model to using the shap values for the analysis 
<br>Task 2 uses the gemini key for API code
