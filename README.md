This repository contains Task 1 and some of Task 2 solved for the Coding Week Machine Learning.
For the Task1 we obtained an accuracy less than the Dumb model predicting No 
The following models of libraries were used:
pandas 2.2.3
numpy 2.2.6
matplotlib 3.10.3
seaborn 0.13.2
plotly 6.1.1
sklearn 1.6.1
The flow of Task 1 file goes like:
